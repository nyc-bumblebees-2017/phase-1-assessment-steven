# Part 3: Object-Oriented Design

## Summary

In Part 3 of the assessment, we'll refactor some provided code for re-usability.
Each class in the application has been tested for its behaviors.  When these
classes were written, knowledge about our application was often times
duplicated in multiple places; in other words, the code is not DRY.

## Running the Tests

If you have questions on how to run the tests, please check the
[rspec-help](../rspec-help.md) document.

## Release 0: Improve Design

Take a moment to review the classes and the corresponding behaviors. Now ask yourself:

* What code smells can you identify?
* What are ways that you can remove these smells while keeping the intended behavior?

Think big picture.  Look at the classes side-by-side.  Don't worry about renaming methods and other minutiae.  This part of the assessment is completed when you've designed the code as best you know how.

Be sure that all tests continue to pass.  Do not modify the tests.

## About Tests

**Passing tests do not indicate that you have completed this portion well.**

The tests are a _guide_ to help you **avoid breaking working code**.  The goal
of this exercise is to move _from_ **working** code that might be unclear,
complicated, oddly-named, etc. _to_ **working** code that **is** clear,
simple, and conventional. Tests simply cannot check that for you.

Great programmers spend their entire careers learning to move code from
"doesn't work" to "works but hacky" to "elegant code." Your assessment review
will be focused on _why_ you made a change and probing your understanding of
the change's impact.

## Conclusion

Once you've made all the changes that you find improve the code, you have
completed Part 3 of the assessment.  If you haven't done so already, commit
your changes and move on to Part 4.
